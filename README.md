## Overview
    Depression is a widespread mental health disorder affecting millions worldwide.  In the age of social media, it is crucial to leverage technology to detect, help, and support individuals displaying symptoms online. Our investigation revealed that social media, particularly Reddit, has a wide demographic of people and hosts a variety of discussion topics, including a significant number of posts on mental health. Using the large amounts of data on Reddit, the goal is to train and develop various machine learning models to recognize manifestations of depression and evaluating their performance. These models include machine learning and deep learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), transformers, and various Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures — simple RNNs, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units — for sentiment analysis and depression detection on Reddit. The objective is to evaluate and enhance the models’ accuracy. Early detection facilitated by such models could potentially mitigate the impact of mental health disorders through timely intervention and support mechanisms.
